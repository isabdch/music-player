## ‚úèÔ∏è Project Description

This is a simple music player with some songs I enjoy hearing. You can control the volume, the current time of the song, etc. Also, I added the repeat and shuffle options. Each music has its own colors and page style. If you click on the artist's name you'll go to their Spotify profile. Enjoy!
